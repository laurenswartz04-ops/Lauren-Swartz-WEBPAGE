                            <p class="text-black-40 mb-0">My first project has three parts, exploring the capacity and effectiveness of 3D printers and designs. To start out, I printed a simple nametag, familiarizing myself with how to import designs into the Prusa Slicer software, alter them to my preferences, and transfer them to the Prusa MINI+ to print. I edited the words to display my first and last name, and selected the writing font that I preferred. After exporting the file design to a flashdrive, I set up my first filament color. It began to print, and when the color change was required, I switched out the filament.
                            </p>

                            </p>
                            <p class="text-black-40 mb-0">My finished nametag printed fairly well, with strings around the lettering. I believe this could be caused by the font choice being a bit thin and the temperature. The font size also varies, with some sections of lettering appearing much thinner or thicker than others. These inconsistencies may be due to difficulty of my font size choice.

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">For my calibration (torture) print to test the capabilities of the 3D printer, I chose to print a DNA double helix. This showed me that the printer is able to produce tall, stable, unsupported prints with repetitive complex designs and generally effective bridging between different components of the print. There was some slight stringyness and draping of filament between some of the rungs(or bridges) of the double helix, but those could be easily removed. These minute errors could be a result of incorrect retracting speed, but also potentially due to lack of supports. I learned that thicker unsupported pieces of a print are less difficult to produce, as compared to thinner unsupported pieces. Also, the slight overhangs of the curved sides were successful, showing a strength of the print. The print had a smooth, stable, base that allows it to stand up straight. My biochemistry friend who I gave this to was a big fan, and it now stands on his desk. Overall, I was happy with this print.

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">For my open-source assistive print of the project, I made a jar lid opener for users that may struggle with hand strength and dexterity. It could also be for people who experience joint pain. I found the design on the website 
                                    <a href="https://www.makersmakingchange.com">MakersMakingChange.com. </a>
The print came out almost entirely successful. The only issue that I came across was that the print struggled from poor bridging on the end of the hook. This is something I was initially slightly concerned with, but the hook did not seem to be too large of an unsupported protrusion. The preview on the Prusa software did acknowledge it as bridge infill, but this draping of filament is most likely due to speed of extrusion of filament or lack of supports for the cantilever. I could easily clean it up to be a fully working jar opener, so I wouldn't make any changes!

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">For the first part of this project, I began with creating a planter on TinkerCAD. With a more easy to use interface and pre-prepared shapes that I could import into my workspace, this was a much simpler process. After importing a rectangle and adjusting it to the measurements I wanted, I created a slightly smaller version of the same rectangle and selected “Hole”. I then moved this negative space down on the Z-axis to make the bottom of the planter hollow. To make this one piece, I created a union between the shapes. Selecting four cylinders from the TinkerCAD shape library, I adjusted the width and height to position them as posts. Placing a round roof shape on top of these posts, I began changing the materials and colors of the planter. To make the roof semi-clear in order to see the pre-made planters, I adjusted the transparency to my liking. I then inserted the pre-made plants.
                                    </p>
                                    <p margin-bottom: 1em;>
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="text-white-50 mb-0">Transitioning over to Fusion CAD software, the interface was a bit more complex and open ended. To create the planter, I first used the sketch tool to make a rectangle and extruded it to become a 3D shape. To make the hollow space in the middle of the planter, I repeated these steps on a smaller rectangle. However, rather than positively extruding the shape, I negatively extruded it. In order to position the four cylinders symmetrically, I sketched a circle and positively extruded it to create the cylinder shape. Using the Pattern function under the create tab, I adjusted the cylinders to 4 and altered their location to match the edges of the planter. After sketching and extruding another rectangle slightly larger than the base, I rounded the edge of the roof using the Fillet feature under the Modify tab. To make it see-through, I adjusted the appearance to be “Bronze Glass”. Coloring the other components of the printer, I selected “Green Powder” and “Natural Wax”. An important note was to ground the cylindrical posts by making them components. Overall, using Fusion I could be much more precise and specific in what I wanted to create. I also had more options when it came to the aesthetic design, and could exercise more control over each part of the planter. The absence of pre-made shapes made the initial usage of the software a bit more difficult to understand, but after familiarizing myself it was a bit easier to use.

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">For the second section of this project, I took a design of a Tea Bag Dispenser from 
                                        <a href="https://thangs.com">Thangs.com, </a> with the goal of adding a side trash compartment to it. I first sketched out a very simple drawing of what I wanted it to look like. After inputting the file into TinkerCAD, I added a side rectangle and repeated the step above to make it a hollow container. I then created a union between the two rectangle shapes I added to make them one component. After importing the file to Prusa, I printed it using the 3D printer. This print came out successfully for the most part, as the two shapes appeared as I had anticipated. However, the trash compartment was not connected to the dispenser itself. Going back through my design process, I realized that I did not create a union between the two pieces, which could have led to them printing separately in Prusa. 114.22 grams of filament were used for this print.
                                    </p>
                                    <p margin-bottom: 1em;>

                                    <p class="text-white-50 mb-0">Repeating the process in Fusion, I imported the design and sketched a rectangle that I extruded. I then negatively extruded another rectangle to make the compartment hollow. To attach them and make sure the bases of both pieces were the same height when printing, I adjusted the height of the compartment and constrained the components to make them on a singular body. After importing this design to Prusa, I made sure the design was level and printed it on the Prusa Mini+, using 110.98 grams of PLA filament. Interestingly enough, although the trash compartment was attached to the dispenser, some issue happened when transitioning from the printing of the base to the walls of the dispenser, causing the layer to somehow shift. I don’t know what variables possibly changed in between these two sections, but it led to a printing issue for the rest of the design. With more time, I would be curious to try and reprint the design in order to see if it was a printer issue as I believe it to be, rather than a software issue.
                                    </p>
                                    <p margin-bottom: 1em;>
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="text-white-50 mb-0"> The difference between the grams of filament used could be due to the slightly different sizing of the trash compartment that I did, and also due to the differences in CAD software. Overall, it was very interesting to use both software platforms to create the same design. In the future, I would make sure that the different parts of the design are connected in whichever software I use. Perhaps I would also adjust the width of the container to fit specific sizes of tea bags. I would also like to be there to check in on my Fusion print to see what happened in between the base and the walls section.
